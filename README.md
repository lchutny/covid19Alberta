My personal Repo on Alberta's Covid 19 data

Data collected daily (manually) from Government of Alberta's
website at https://www.alberta.ca/coronavirus-info-for-albertans.aspx and subsites

The daily statistics are often updated even for historical data, so I go back and update that data daily:  
- New Positive Tests  
- Daily Negative Tests  
- Total Hospitalized
- Total ICU admissions  
- Deaths  
- Recovered  

---  
UPDATES:  
March 15 - April 5, 2020
Up to April 5, reporting was only New Positive tests, Daily Negative tests. Recovered, Current Hospitalized, Current ICU and total deaths were extracted from textual reports.

April 6, 2020

April 6, the Positive Tests were split into Confirmed and Probable. An additional table showing total hospitalized to date and ICU to date were added to the Province's data reporting page.  
Additionally, starting April 6, daily reporting from here will not show the current day's date, as reporting for the current day is incomplete and gives a false picture.
