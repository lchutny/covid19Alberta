My personal Repo on Alberta's Covid 19 data

Data collected daily (manually) from Government of Alberta's
website at https://www.alberta.ca/coronavirus-info-for-albertans.aspx and subsites

The daily statistics are often updated even for historical data, so I go back and update that data daily:  
- New Positive Tests  
- Daily Negative Tests  
- Total Hospitalized
- Total ICU admissions  
- Deaths  
- Recovered
