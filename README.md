My personal Repo on Alberta's Covid 19 data

Data collected daily (manually) from Government of Alberta's
website at https://www.alberta.ca/coronavirus-info-for-albertans.aspx and subsites

The daily statistics are often updated even for historical data, so I go back and update that data daily:  
- New Positive Tests  
- Daily Negative Tests  
- Total Hospitalized
- Total ICU admissions  
- Deaths  
- Recovered  

---  
UPDATES:  
March 15 - April 5, 2020  
Up to April 5, reporting was only New Positive tests, Daily Negative tests. Recovered, Current Hospitalized, Current ICU and total deaths were extracted from textual reports.

---  
April 6, 2020  
April 6, the Positive Tests were split into Confirmed and Probable. An additional table showing total hospitalized to date and ICU to date were added to the Province's data reporting page.  
Additionally, starting April 6, daily reporting from here will not show the current day's date, as reporting for the current day is incomplete and gives a false picture.

April 7, 2020:  
Alberta Health said the temporary decline in testing is the delayed result of the changes implemented on March 23. At that time, Alberta shifted its priorities from testing people returning from travel after March 12 who had mild symptoms to testing anyone who is symptomatic and:

Is hospitalized with respiratory illness
Is a resident in a continuing care home or similar facility
Has returned from travelling abroad between March 8 and March 12 (before the self-isolation protocols were in place)
Is a health-care worker with respiratory symptoms. “We expanded Alberta’s testing criteria [Monday] and expect testing numbers will rise back to maximum capacity very soon,” spokesperson Tom McMillan told Global News in an email.  

Also, note that the testing numbers on Alberta Health which were previously reported as 'Negative tests' are now 'Total People Tested'. This has been accounted for in my calculations.

In the last week, there are two incomplete days of data (April 15 and 16) due to a fire in the datacentre at AHS. Also note that testing protocols have shifted significantly since the beginning of the pandemic. All numbers and graphs based on testing results, such as number of positive tests are biased. This bias needs to be accounted for. The only true results that are somewhat independent of tests are Hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths, although these still suffer from being recorded as 'related to covid-19' which rely on a positive test confirmation. However, the bias here is likely much lower, as the number of people in ICU, for example, that are placed in ICU for respiratory trouble who are not tested for Covid-19 is likely effectively zero. A fuller exploration of this next week.
